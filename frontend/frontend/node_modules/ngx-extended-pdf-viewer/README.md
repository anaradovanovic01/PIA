## Bringing PDF to the Angular world

This library provides an embeddable PDF viewer component. It's different from other approaches like [ng2-pdf-viewer](https://vadimdez.github.io/ng2-pdf-viewer/) in that it shows the full suite of UI widgets. In other words, it strongly resembles the PDF viewer of your browser:

## What's new in Version 19?

Version 19 updates to pdf.js 4.0, and that means breaking changes. I hope most of you won't even notice it, but under the hood, there's a lot of change. So I decided to do a bold step and update ngx-extended-pdf-viewer to Angular 17.

My promise of backward compatibility to roughly 3-4 version still holds, so I'm going to maintain version 18 for a while. I also hope that version 19 is compatible to Angular 14, 15, and 16, but at the moment, it's too early to promise anything.

In a nutshell:

- You're using Angular 16? Give ngx-extended-pdf-viewer 19 a try. My preliminary compatibility test indicates it's compatible. If it isn't, please tell me about it.
- You're using Angular 15 or below? Stick to ngx-extended-pdf-viewer@18. But brace yourself for an update. Supporting two version simultaneously is painful to me, so I won't do this forever.
- You've invested in the old i18n API, or you can't update because of a breaking change? Please tell me about your issue (for example, at https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/discussions/1976).
- You're using Angular 17 and can afford to start fresh? Go for version 19, including the alpha versions!

Breaking changes of version 19:

- The attribute `useBrowserLocale` and the inlined translations are gone.
- Many translation keys have changed. If you're using custom translations, you'll need to update them and to migrate to the FTL format.

### What's the difference between the stable and the bleeding-edge version of pdf.js?

The bleeding edge branch is the latest developer version of pdf.js (usually one to three weeks behind). In theory, this means it might be buggy, but the pdf.js teams manage to deliver a remarkable high quality. Most of the bugs of the bleeding-edge version are my bugs, usually caused by merging, and that's also the reason why I maintain this branch. It helps me to spot bugs early. I'm always happy when people use the bleeding-edge branch and report errors, as long as you keep in mind it's not intended to be used in production.

## What's new in Version 18?

As mentioned above, I'll maintain version 18 for a short while because version 19 requires Angular 17 or above. If you're using Angular 12-15, stick to ngx-extended-pdf-viewer 18, and if you're using Angular 16, my preliminary tests indicate you can use either version of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer.

Version 18 ships with quite a few improvements:

- It updates the find API,
- brings toolbar customization and responsive design to another level,
- gives you the option to add many buttons to the toolbar that used to hide in the secondary menu,
- adds more flexibility with for `[pageViewMode]`, `[scrollMode]`, and `[spreadMode]`,
- and updates to pdf.js 3.10 in the stable branch and to pdf.js 3.11 in the bleeding-edge branch.
- The bleeding-edge branch, in turn, gives you a sneak preview of the new "stamp" editor, which allows you to add images to PDF files.

A slightly modified layout is a side-effect of the improvements of the toolbar and the secondary menu. Most people won't notice, but if you're using screenshot tests, expect them to break.

The updated find API brings a couple of breaking changes. I removed the fuzzy search, the multiple words-search, and the current page / page range search. "Ignore accent" now is "match diacritics." When you migrate your code, you'll have to invert your boolean logic because "ignore accents" is the opposite of "match diacritics". Along the way, I noticed that the find API didn't work as expected. I fixed several bugs and added more fields to the events. If you rely on the old events, brace yourself for (minor) breaking changes. Plus, I've renamed, moved, and even removed a couple of classes to make the
new file structure match the simplified find bar.

The breaking changes became nessary because maintaining the library became more time-consuming with each version of pdf.js. Even worse,
the pdf.js team worked heavily on the find algorithm, but I wasn't able to merge their improvements during the last one or two years. So I had to reduce the differences between the libraries. In other words, I pruned ngx-extended-pdf-viewer. I'm positive I've finished pruning, so in the future, there will be fewer breaking changes. Please apologize for the inconvenience!

If you need the old extended find bar, please stick to version 17. I've split off a separate branch, so I can maintain version 17 in parallel for a while.

A small breaking change affects single-page mode. I've removed a CSS rule that pushed the page to the left. If you don't like the page to be centered, you can add the CSS rules in your global `style.css`:

```CSS
.pdfViewer.singlePageView .page {
  margin: 0;
}
```

### Note on version 18.1.0

I've changed the ids of the "next" and "previous" buttons, both in the primary toolbar and the secondary menu. Plus, I've fixed a bug that prevented the pagination buttons to show in the secondary menu. Strictly speaking, this is a breaking change, but it's so small I decided to call it minor version update.

### Known bugs

To my surprise, form support is broken in version 18.0.0-18.0.3. That's a high-priority ticket, so it should be history soon. Nonethless, it shows that version 18 does add several new (and unexpected) bugs. Have a look at the bug tracker before updating.

### Note on breaking changes

The last two versions brought a lot of breaking changes, some of them very annoying to users relying on them. I'm sorry about that. I had to prune the library because progress of the base library has shyrocketed. It became next to impossible to keep up with the pace. The good news is now I'm confident I can keep up with the pace of the base library now. I don't expect new major breaking changes any time soon. Minor breaking changes - in particular, changes related to CSS - are always possible, but I'll try hard to avoid them.

## Alternatives

Even I have to admit my pet project doesn't match every requirement. There are several alternatives out there. Feel free to expand the description to learn what other developers have in store for you:

<details>
  <summary><b>Expand to learn more about the other options to display PDF files in Angular</b></summary>
  If you only need the base functionality, I'll happily pass you to <a href="https://github.com/vadimdez/ng2-pdf-viewer/" target="#">the project of Vadym Yatsyuk</a>. Vadym does a great job delivering a no-nonsense PDF viewer. However, if you need something that can easily pass as the native viewer on a gloomy day, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is your friend.

There's also a direct counterpart to my library: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer" target="#">ng2-pdfjs-viewer</a>. As far as I can see, it's also a good library. As of May 2021, it's running on PDF.js 2.2.171. It wraps the PDF viewer in an iFrame. That's a more reliable approach, but it also offers fewer options. The list of attributes is shorter, and the PDF viewer can't emit events to your application. If you're not happy with my library, check out ng2-pdfjs-viewer. It's a good library, too. Its unique selling point is displaying multiple PDF files simultaneously on the same page.

You might also try to use the native PDF viewer of your browser. That's a valid approach. It's even the preferred approach. However, `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` gives you a wide range of options that aren't available using the native API.

</details>

## How to use the library

As a rule of thumb, I recommend cloning the [showcase project from GitHub](https://github.com/stephanrauh/extended-pdf-viewer-showcase) before doing anything else. It's a standard Angular CLI application, so you'll get it up and running in less than ten minutes. It's a good starting point to do your experiments. Maybe even more important: you'll learn whether the library works on your machine. (Of course, it does, but it's always good to double-check!)

Currently, the minimum required version is Angular 12. The idea is to support the four most current versions of Angular, which gives you roughly two years to update. However, supporting so many versions isn't always possible.

1. run `npm add ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` and accept all the defaults
2. There's an example component, but it isn't yet part of your application. You can either add the example component to your application or copy the relevant line to your HTML template:

```html
<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
```

If you're running a non-standard configuration, have a look at <a href="https://pdfviewer.net/extended-pdf-viewer/getting-started">the getting-started page"</a> of the showcase.

## Configuration, options, and events

See [the attribute list on the showcase](https://pdfviewer.net/attributes) and the [list of default options page](https://pdfviewer.net/extended-pdf-viewer/default-options). The lists have become too long to put them here: 87 `@Input()` attributes, 25 event emitters, and 50 default options, give or take a few.

Missing a configuration option? File an issue on the [project bug tracker](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ExploringAngular/tree/main/embedding-pdf). If your request makes sense to me and if I can implement it in my (limited) leisure time, I'll add it. BTW, you can speed up the process by providing a code snippet telling me how to implement the feature or by submitting a pull request.

## Searching programmatically

The service `NgxExtendedPdfViewerService` offers a programmatic API for searching, printing, dealing with layers, and scrolling within the page.

Thanks to the awesome pdf.js team and all the users who've reported bugs and even sent me pull requests!

## Internet Explorer 11 is no longer supported

Reluctantly, I have to drop support for Internet Explorer 11. The base library, Mozilla's pdf.js, now generates binaries no longer compatible with Internet Explorer 11, and it seems there's no easy fix. That's a pity because IE11 support was the original use-case of the library and because I frequently get messages from developers who need IE11 support. The last version known to be compatible is 5.3. Version 7.3.2 should be compatible, too, but a user reported crashes.
